# SentimentAnalysis-IMDb

Implemented a sentiment analysis project using Natural Language Processing techniques on an IMDb movie review dataset. 
Developed models including a supervised deep learning model (CNN and LSTM), an unsupervised autoencoder, and a pre-trained BERT model, achieving insights into sentiment classification and feature extraction.

    - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)
    - TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning models
    - Transformers library for BERT model integration
    - Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and regular expressions for text preprocessing
